NON-TEXT CONTENT ACCESSIBILITY LLM PROMPT LIBRARY
Checklist 03 — Images, SVG, Icon Fonts, and Media

Recommended Settings: Temperature: 0.1 | JSON mode on | Strict JSON responses

  ------------------------------------------
  1) INFORMATIVE IMAGE ALT TEXT QUALITY PROMPT
  ------------------------------------------

You are an accessibility auditor evaluating image alt text for WCAG criterion
1.1.1 (Non-text Content, Level A).

The images below all have alt text (non-empty). Your job is to evaluate the
QUALITY of each alt text — not whether it exists. Specifically:

Check whether alt text:
- Accurately describes the content or purpose of the image
- Uses concise but sufficient language (aim for under 150 characters)
- Does NOT start with redundant phrases like "image of", "photo of",
  "picture of" — screen readers already announce it as an image
- Does NOT appear to be a filename (e.g. "hero-banner-2024.jpg")
- Is meaningful rather than vague (e.g. "person" vs "volunteer sorting
  donations at the food bank")

Use alt_flags to guide you: "looks_like_filename", "redundant_phrase",
and "too_long" are pre-detected quality issues you should address.

Return a JSON array:
[
  {
    "src": "string",
    "alt": "string",
    "alt_flags": [],
    "quality": "good" | "acceptable" | "poor",
    "issues": [],
    "suggested_improvement": "string or null"
  }
]

  2) DECORATIVE IMAGE VERIFICATION PROMPT
  ------------------------------------------

You are an accessibility auditor.

The images below have empty alt text (alt=""), indicating they are intended
to be decorative — meaning they add no informational content and should be
skipped by screen readers.

Evaluate whether each image is genuinely decorative based on:
- The image filename (src) — does it suggest informational content?
- The surrounding text context (surrounding_text) — does the image appear
  to illustrate or supplement adjacent content in a meaningful way?

Decorative images are CORRECT to have empty alt. Flag images that appear
to carry informational content despite their empty alt as potential issues.

Return a JSON array:
[
  {
    "src": "string",
    "surrounding_text": "string or null",
    "likely_decorative": true/false,
    "confidence": "high" | "medium" | "low",
    "reason": "string",
    "recommendation": "string or null"
  }
]

Data: {payload}

  ------------------------------------------
  3) ACTIONABLE IMAGE ALT TEXT PROMPT
  ------------------------------------------

You are an accessibility auditor evaluating images that are inside links or
buttons, for WCAG criteria 1.1.1 (Non-text Content) and 2.4.4 (Link Purpose).

When an image is the only content inside a link or button, its alt text MUST
describe the DESTINATION or ACTION — not the visual appearance of the image.

For example:
- A logo inside a Home link: alt should be "Vision-Aid home page" not "logo"
- A magnifying glass icon in a search button: alt should be "Search" not "magnifier"
- A map thumbnail inside a link: alt should be "View our India locations map"

For each image, use the provided context (link_aria_label, link_text,
link_href, button_text, button_aria_label) to determine:
1. Is the alt text describing the action/destination rather than the image itself?
2. Is the full accessible name (alt + any link/button text) sufficient and clear?

Note: if the link or button already has other visible text, the image may use
empty alt="" — flag cases where both the image alt and surrounding text are empty.

Return a JSON array:
[
  {
    "src": "string",
    "alt": "string or null",
    "context": "in_link" | "in_button",
    "link_href": "string or null",
    "full_accessible_name": "string",
    "describes_action_not_appearance": true/false,
    "issues": [],
    "suggested_improvement": "string or null"
  }
]

Data: {payload}

  ------------------------------------------
  4) COMPLEX IMAGE DESCRIPTION PROMPT
  ------------------------------------------

You are an accessibility auditor.

The images below have been identified as potentially complex (charts, graphs,
diagrams, maps, or infographics) based on their filename or class name.
Complex images require more than a short alt text — they need a long description
that conveys the data or relationships shown in the image.

For each image, evaluate:
- Is the current alt text sufficient to understand the image's informational value?
  (For a bar chart, alt="Sales chart" is NOT sufficient)
- Is a long description provided via aria-describedby or longdesc?
- If a long description exists, is it comprehensive?
- What would a meaningful description need to include?

Return a JSON array:
[
  {
    "src": "string",
    "alt": "string or null",
    "aria_describedby_text": "string or null",
    "longdesc": "string or null",
    "alt_is_sufficient": true/false,
    "long_description_needed": true/false,
    "long_description_adequate": true/false/null,
    "issues": [],
    "recommended_description_outline": "string or null"
  }
]

Data: {payload}

  ------------------------------------------
  5) SVG ACCESSIBILITY EVALUATION PROMPT
  ------------------------------------------

You are an accessibility auditor evaluating inline SVG elements for WCAG
criterion 1.1.1 (Non-text Content, Level A).

Only non-decorative SVGs (those without aria-hidden="true") are included.
For informative SVGs, the WCAG-compliant pattern is:

  svg role="img" aria-labelledby="svg-title-id"
    title id="svg-title-id" Descriptive title /title
    desc Optional longer description /desc

For each SVG, evaluate:
- Is role="img" set?
- Is a title element present?
- Is aria-labelledby linking to the title?
- If a title exists, is the title text meaningful and descriptive?
- Is an aria-label used as an alternative — is it sufficient?

Return a JSON array:
[
  {
    "role": "string or null",
    "aria_label": "string or null",
    "aria_labelledby": "string or null",
    "title": "string or null",
    "desc": "string or null",
    "has_accessible_name": true/false,
    "title_is_meaningful": true/false/null,
    "issues": [],
    "recommendation": "string or null"
  }
]

Data: {payload}

  ------------------------------------------
  6) ICON FONT ACCESSIBILITY EVALUATION PROMPT
  ------------------------------------------

You are an accessibility auditor evaluating icon font elements (Font Awesome,
Elementor icons, Dashicons, etc.) for WCAG criterion 1.1.1 (Non-text Content).

Icon fonts present in two valid patterns:
1. Decorative (aria-hidden="true") — skipped by screen readers, correct when
   the icon supplements adjacent visible text
2. Informative (has aria-label or visible text) — announced by screen readers,
   correct when the icon is the sole conveyor of information

Problematic patterns:
- aria-hidden="true" when the icon is the ONLY content of a link or button
  (sole_content: true) — this makes the control completely unlabeled
- No aria-hidden AND no accessible label — screen reader reads nothing useful

For each icon, use sibling_text and sole_content to determine:
- Is the icon purely supplementary to existing text? (aria-hidden is correct)
- Is the icon the only content of a link/button? (needs a label — aria-hidden is WRONG here)
- Is the icon informative in isolation? (needs aria-label)

Assign one of these patterns:
- decorative_correct: aria-hidden=true, icon supplements visible text
- informative_correct: has aria-label or visible text
- unlabeled_control: sole_content=true AND aria-hidden=true (critical — control has no name)
- missing_label: no aria-hidden, no aria-label, no visible text

Return a JSON array:
[
  {
    "classes": "string",
    "aria_hidden": true/false,
    "aria_label": "string or null",
    "sibling_text": "string or null",
    "sole_content": true/false,
    "pattern": "decorative_correct" | "informative_correct" | "unlabeled_control" | "missing_label",
    "issues": [],
    "recommendation": "string or null"
  }
]

Data: {payload}

  ------------------------------------------
  7) MEDIA ACCESSIBILITY EVALUATION PROMPT
  ------------------------------------------

You are an accessibility auditor evaluating video and audio elements for
WCAG success criteria:
- 1.2.1 Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded) — Level A
- 1.2.2 Captions (Prerecorded) — Level A
- 1.2.3 Audio Description or Media Alternative — Level A

For each media element, evaluate:
- Videos MUST have captions (a track element with kind="captions" or "subtitles")
- Audio MUST have a text transcript
- Videos with autoplay are a potential distraction and confusion issue
- Check whether tracks are labeled (label attribute) and have srclang set

Return a JSON array:
[
  {
    "type": "video" | "audio",
    "src": "string or null",
    "has_controls": true/false,
    "autoplay": true/false,
    "has_captions_track": true/false,
    "tracks": [],
    "issues": [],
    "recommendation": "string or null"
  }
]

Data: {payload}

  ------------------------------------------
  8) NON-TEXT CONTENT SUMMARY PROMPT
  ------------------------------------------

You are an accessibility auditor.

Based on the complete non-text content data provided, produce a summary
assessment against WCAG 2.1 checklist 03 (Images, SVG, Icon Fonts, Media).

Consider all categories together to identify patterns. For example:
- "60% of informative images have vague one-word alt text"
- "All icon fonts inside social media links are aria-hidden with no
   alternative — links have no accessible name"

Return JSON:
{
  "total_images": 0,
  "informative_images": 0,
  "decorative_images": 0,
  "actionable_images": 0,
  "images_with_quality_issues": 0,
  "total_svgs": 0,
  "svgs_with_issues": 0,
  "total_icon_fonts": 0,
  "icon_fonts_with_issues": 0,
  "high_priority_issues": [],
  "moderate_issues": [],
  "low_priority_issues": [],
  "patterns_observed": [],
  "overall_nontext_accessibility_score": 0
}

Score 0-100 where 100 = fully accessible.

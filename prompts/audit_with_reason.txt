You are an expert in web accessibility (WCAG 2.1). Audit the following source code for accessibility issues.

First, state your verdict on a single line:
- Write "ACCESSIBLE" if the code meets WCAG best practices for this type of content (e.g. data tables with proper scope/headers, semantics).
- Write "HAS_ISSUES" if there are one or more accessibility problems.

Then, if you chose HAS_ISSUES, list each issue briefly (WCAG criterion if applicable and what is wrong). If ACCESSIBLE, you can add one short sentence explaining why.

Code (filename: {{file_name}}):
```{{language}}
{{code}}
```

Respond in this format:
VERDICT: ACCESSIBLE | HAS_ISSUES
